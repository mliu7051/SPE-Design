### SPE-Design
This repository contains the code and data associated with the article "A Novel Computational-Experimental Approach for Advanced Solid Polymer Electrolyte Design" by M Liu, CL Clement, K Liu, TD Sparks, and X Wang.

*Final Code.py* is the script containing the linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and SVM models used in the article.

*Feed In Data.csv* contains the data used in the paper, organized into three datasets with columns for LiTFSI weight percentage, temperature in Celsius, and log-conductivity (referred to as "exponent"). Dataset 3 is a superset of Dataset 2, and Dataset 2 a superset of Dataset 1.
