### SPE-Design
This repository contains the code and data associated with the article *A Data Science Approach for Advanced Solid Polymer Electrolyte Design* by M Liu, CL Clement, K Liu, X Wang, and TD Sparks.

- *Gridsearch Experiments* is the script containing the linear, lasso, ridge, decision tree, random forest, and SVM regression models discussed in the article.

- *Feed In Data.csv* contains the data used in the paper, organized into three datasets with columns for LiTFSI weight percentage, temperature in Celsius, and log-conductivity (referred to as "exponent"). Dataset 3 is a superset of Dataset 2, and Dataset 2 a superset of Dataset 1.
